## Jeff Thomas

Hello!  I am a data enthusiast and have worked with data in some facet for over 20-years.  I love being able to take data from a form that many people canâ€™t work with and turn it into something useful.  I work with data on a daily basis by reading in csv files from various sources, cleaning, transforming, and writing outcome dataframes to new reports. My education journey started with my Associate of Web/Data Base programming at [Metropolitan Community College](https://www.mccneb.edu/), and then went on to obtain my Bachelor of Data Science at [Bellevue University]( https://www.bellevue.edu/).  I graduated with my Bachelor of Data Science from Bellevue in 2023. I'm now in the Masters of Data Science (MSDS) program at Bellevue University. I am currently on track to graduate with my Masters of Data Science in the Fall of 2025.  I currently use Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, and Numpy in my daily work life to help me create reports and solve problems.  I have also learned other skill sets such as machine learning and predictive analytics while gaining my degree.
