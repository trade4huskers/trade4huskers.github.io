## Jeff Thomas

Hello!  I am a data enthusiast and have worked with data in some facet for over 20-years.  I love being able to take data from a form that most people canâ€™t work with and turn it into something useful.  For the majority of my career, I mostly worked with data using Microsoft Excel.  However, about 6-years I started a new chapter of my life by going back to college and began an educational journey in all things data.  I first got my Associate of Web/Data Base programming, and then went on to my Bachelor of Data Science at [Bellevue University]( https://www.bellevue.edu/).  I currently use Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, and Numpy in my daily work life to help me create reports and solve problems.  I have also learned other skill sets such as machine learning and predictive analytics while gaining my degree.
